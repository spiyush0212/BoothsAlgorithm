# BoothsAlgorithm
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement the Booth’s algorithm for multiplying binary numbers

SOLUTION
In this project, we have designed an implementation of the Booth’s Algorithm for multiplication.
The program takes two numbers from user as input in Decimal Format. Then, in the backend, it converts the numbers into Binary Format and then, executes the Booth’s Algorithm on the numbers and on the Java console it displays the final output after multiplication to the user while it also creates a text file (.txt) and generates all the step by step logic behind the final output.
